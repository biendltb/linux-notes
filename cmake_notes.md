## CMake
#### Header
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

# set project name and version
project(<project_name> VERSION 1.0)

# specify the C++ standard: 11 or 17
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)
```

#### Find a library
```cmake
find_package(PackageName 2.0 REQUIRED)
if(NOT PackageName_FOUND)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "PackageName not found")
endif()
```
* Library variables (e.g. `<PackageName>_LIBS`, `<PackageName>_INCLUDE_DIR` will be set after the library found)
* `<PackageName>_FOUND` indicates if the package found
* Version `2.0` speficied could match 2.x, use `EXAC` to find the packlage in the exact version
* Use `REQUIRED` to to show error if package not found and `QUIET` to ignore

#### Build a library
```cmake
set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib)

# add library: add our own code so that the executable could use when they are compiled
add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} SHARED
    src/abc/def.cc
    ...
)

target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}
    ${lib1_LIBS}
    ${lib2_LIBRARIES}
    ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/Thirdparty/<LibraryName>/lib/lib<LibraryName>.so
)

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}
${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}
${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
${LibAbc_INCLUDE_DIR}
${LibXyz_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

```
#### Build an executable
```cmake
# specified place to save executable file
# unless executable file will be saved to build by default
set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/abc/def)

# Specify source files to build
set(SOURCES
    ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/abc/xyz.cc
    path/to/source/file.cc
}

# add executable for demo, test, examples, etc.
add_executable(<executable_name>
    path/to/executable.cc
    ${SOURCES}
)
target_include_directories(<executable_name> ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
target_link_libraries(<executable_name> ${PROJECT_NAME} ${<PackageName_LIBS>})
```
#### GLOB
Instead of listing all the source files as shown above, GLOB makes listing source file easier.
```cmake
file(GLOB SOURCES
    "abc/*.cc"
    "abc/def/*.cc"
)
# message(STATUS ${SOURCES}
```

#### Main CMakeLists.txt
Multiple CMakeLists.txt of different modules could be build at the same time. All we need to do is adding sub-directories which contains CMakeLists.txt to the main CMakeLists.txt
```cmake
# Main CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

# set project name and version
project(<project_name> VERSION 1.0)

# specify the C++ standard: 11 or 17
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

add_subdirectory(/modules/abc/)
```

#### Simple `CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

# set project name and version
project(<project_name> VERSION 1.0)

# specify the C++ standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)


# ======================= FIND LIBRARIES TO USE IN LATER STEPS
# find a package with version, `<PackageName>_FOUND` indicates if the package found
# Note: 2.0 could match 2.x, use `EXACT` to find the package in the exact version
# Use `REQUIRED` to show error if package not found, use `QUIET` to ignore
# library variables (e.g. `lib1_LIBS`, `lib1_INCLUDE_DIR` will be set after the library found)
find_package(PackageName 2.0 REQUIRED)
if(NOT PackageName_FOUND)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "PackageName not found")
endif()

# ======================= BUILD A LIBRARY
# specify place to store the `.so` library of our project
# output library name: `lib<project_name>.so`
set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib)

# add library: add our own code so that the executable could use when they are compiled
add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} SHARED
    src/abc/def.cc
    ...
)

# link libraries needed to build the project
# the first argument is the name of target lib/executable
# the variable name of included libraries could be generated by find_package or specified if the library is included in the project
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}
    ${lib1_LIBS}
    ${lib2_LIBRARIES}
    ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/Thirdparty/<LibraryName>/lib/lib<LibraryName>.so
)

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}
${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}
${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
${LibAbc_INCLUDE_DIR}
${LibXyz_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

# ======================= BUILD AN EXECUTABLE
# specified place to save executable file
# unless executable file will be saved to build by default
set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/abc/def)

# add executable for demo, test, examples, etc.
add_executable(<executable_name>
    path/to/executable.cc
    ${SOURCES}
)
target_include_directories(<executable_name> ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
target_link_libraries(<executable_name> ${PROJECT_NAME})

```
